## Main Features
- Auto-play midi files
- Transpose (Pitch Shifting)
- Auto sustain & sustain controls

## How to Install
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) chrome extension.
2. Add Playbot script to Tampermonkey.
3. Tampermonkey will automatically run Playbot script if you visit Shared Piano webpage.

## How to Use
1. Open Shared Piano webpage and press `ctrl + m`.
3. Select your midi file from the file explorer.
4. Hit `Enter` to start playing. (please wait for a second)

## Shortcuts
### Main control
- Open file explorer: `ctrl + m`
- Start playing: `Enter`

### Transpose
No need to press `shift` key.
- Pitch +1: `+` 
- Pitch -1: `-`

### Sustain
Sustain will automatically be turned on.
- Turn off: `‚Üê`
- Turn on with minimum interval: `‚Üí`
- Longer interval: `‚Üë`
- Shorter interval: `‚Üì`

## Reminder
- Too much amplitude will cause **audio clipping**.
  - Try *Night of Nights black midi* if you're curious.üòâ
- Too long sustain interval will trigger Tone.js limit & cause **load error** from Shared Piano.
  - In this case, some keys won't sound properly.
  - It will be fixed if you immediately turn off the sustain with `‚Üê` key for a bit.

## WIP
- ~~Direct midi file convert~~ ‚úÖ **Support since v1.0!**
- Velocity

#### WIP but not soon
- Better sustain interval
- UI
